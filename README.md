Dataset Description
In this competition, you are provided with a time-series forecasting problem centered around cinema audience attendance. The data comes from two separate booking platforms:

BookNow: an online booking and aggregation platform where users can search theatres and book tickets in advance.

CinePOS: a point-of-sale (POS) system installed at theaters that tracks on-site ticket sales.

Notes
Audience counts can be influenced by holidays, weekends, theatre type, and booking trends.
The dataset is anonymized; latitude and longitude are approximate values.
Use both POS and online booking patterns to forecast future theatre audiences.
Some theatres may be closed on certain days, leading to zero audiences. Such days are included in the dataset but are ignored in final scoring.
